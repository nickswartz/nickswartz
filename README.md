#H1I'm Nick Swartz
I am currently a junior informatics student here at Indiana University. My cognate is human-centered computing with a minor in human-computer interaction. A fun fact about me is that I have lived in Wisconsin, Arizona, Indiana, and Florida.
In my free time, I enjoy:
1. Golfing
2. Playing pickleball
3. Watching movies

[Here is a video of my favorite active golfer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrsONIBo-Bs&t=347s)
